### Professional Background
I am working as NLP Research Engineer at Verisk Analytics on Muti-hop reasoning, Information Extraction and Natural Language Generation in NLP . I completed Master's in Computer Science from [New York University’s](http://www.nyu.edu/) [Courant Institute of Mathmatical Sciences](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html) in 2019. I was advised by Prof. Samuel R.Bowman. I was also part of [ML^2 Group](https://wp.nyu.edu/ml2/) at [CILVR Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/).  Broadly, my research interests are machine learning and natural language processing.

#### Improving pre-training and decoding in Machine Translation
There have been lot of recent advances in Machine Translation that have focused on network architectures, attention mechanisms and sequence-level training. Most of the approaches emphasize on modelling the languages better using attention. Here we explore three methods that rely on augmenting data using a pseudo-parallel corpus, improving the decoding strategy and pre-training the encoders and evaluate their effect on the machine translation task.

#### Statistical Machine Translation
Implemented a word-based statistical translation model (IBM Model) that extracts phrases using word alignment and performs parameter estimation for partially observed data using expectation maximization.
--->
<!---
#### Text Classifier
Implemented maximum entropy classifier character model and feature extractor code for word classification. Further improved the model by implementing a one layer Perceptron.

#### Hidden Markov Model for part of speech tagger
Implemented a Hidden Markov model tagger using forward-backward algorithm and Viterbi decoder for unlabeled text data.

#### Nowcasted Gross Domestic Product
Implemented Stochastic modeling techniques for modeling structured products and the underlying economic variables were now-casted using Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model.

#### Operating System - Process Scheduler and Virtual Memory Manager
Process Scheduler: Implemented scheduling policies  (First In First Out, Last In Last Out, Shortest Job First, RoundRobin and PriorityScheduler) on processes executing on a system using Discrete Event Simulation}
Virtual Memory Manager: Implemented the core features of a virtual memory manager serving multiple processes and under memory constraints.
